<p>Welcome to Generic Sections, powered by the Ai-em Content Mangement System.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Ai-em CMS is designed to be both simple and powerful. This is achieved by the system only being aware of two types of general information. Sections and data. The third hidden component are the templates themselves. These can't be changed to ensure clean results.</p>

<p>Most importantly, sections correspond exactly to URLs and can be nested as much as desired.  On this site the Mike Miller section gives rise to the URL: <br />http://www.properbikeco.com/<strong>team/mikemiller</strong> because Mike Miller is contained within another Section 'Team', which is at the top level of the site.</p>

<p>Any section can use a template. These can be changed by clicking on a section and then on Change Template.  These templates are internal and will dicate exactly how each dynamic section will look. However they cannot display correctly unless data has been supplied to them in a structure which it is expecting to see.</p> 

<p>Perhaps confusingly data items can be nested within further data items but this is crucial to allow for complex templates.  Apart from containers, data items correspond to any chunk of information that has been uploaded to the site such as a piece of text, an image or a video.  Data can have secondary text associated with it by using the 'Meta' button. This can be useful for giving an image a title as an example.</p>
